He may use his keyboard only and/or special hearing devices. <a href=\"https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-hearing\">According to the NIDCD</a> 2-3 out of 1000 children are born with hearing loss and ~15% of all american adults report having troubles hearing. Also, <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/disability.htm\">according to the CDC</a> ~15% of the US Adults have physical disabilities. Audio accessibility is not only about deaf bus also covers public places where the user might not be able to use audio. Physical accessibility covers every user using a keyboard, disabilities causing the hand to tremble/shake and users using eyetracking software or the like."
